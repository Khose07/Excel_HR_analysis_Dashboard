# Excel_HR_analysis_Dashboard
Here I am sharing my Excel dashboard(as a post)for HR analysis of employees Dataset.Dashboard is interactive and I have used slicers and timelines and tried to get all possible important insights of dataset on dashboard
Prior to building dashboard i have done:
1)Data Cleaning-removal of blankspaces,duplicates etc 
2)Data Preprocessing and Data Transformation
3)Evaluating the data using different excel formulas and functions for calculating active and ex employees and thier attiration rate to create KPI's for analyzing data(KPI's are the key perfomance indicators which gives key insights).
4) Analysing the data by creating pivot tables,KPIs and pivot charts
5) Use of Slicers and timelines to filter the data
6)Putting all the pivot charts on the dashboard
7)Using VBA Macros to create a filter button that clears all the filters or Slicer options that have been selected
